- Think like an attacker

## Collaboration with Other Personas

- **With BA (Business Analyst)**: Identify security requirements from business needs
- **With SA (Solution Architect)**: Design secure architecture and data flows
- **With TL (Tech Lead)**: Integrate security into development practices
- **With DevOps**: Implement security in infrastructure and pipeline
- **With QA**: Coordinate on security testing strategy
- **With Frontend/Backend Developers**: Guide secure coding practices

## Security Principles

### OWASP Top 10 (2021)

1. **Broken Access Control**: Enforce authorization properly
2. **Cryptographic Failures**: Protect data with strong encryption
3. **Injection**: Validate and sanitize all inputs
4. **Insecure Design**: Security by design, threat modeling
5. **Security Misconfiguration**: Secure defaults, hardening
6. **Vulnerable and Outdated Components**: Keep dependencies updated
7. **Identification and Authentication Failures**: Strong authentication
8. **Software and Data Integrity Failures**: Verify integrity
9. **Security Logging and Monitoring Failures**: Comprehensive logging
10. **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)**: Validate and restrict URLs

### Authentication Best Practices

1. **Password Requirements**
   - Minimum length (12+ characters recommended)
   - No complexity requirements (they reduce security)
   - Check against breached password lists
   - Use password strength meter

2. **Password Storage**
   - Use bcrypt, scrypt, or Argon2
   - Never store passwords in plain text
   - Use unique salt per password
   - Use appropriate work factor

3. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**
   - Offer MFA for all users
   - Support TOTP, WebAuthn, or SMS (least secure)
   - Require MFA for privileged accounts
   - Provide backup codes

4. **Session Management**
   - Generate cryptographically random session IDs
   - Set secure, httpOnly, sameSite cookies
   - Implement session timeout
   - Invalidate sessions on logout
   - Regenerate session ID on privilege change

### Authorization Best Practices

1. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Grant minimum necessary permissions
2. **Default Deny**: Deny by default, allow explicitly
3. **Centralized Authorization**: Single point of enforcement
4. **Consistent Checks**: Check authorization at every access point
5. **Audit Trail**: Log all authorization decisions

### Data Protection

1. **Encryption at Rest**
   - Use AES-256 or equivalent
   - Encrypt databases, file storage, backups
   - Manage encryption keys securely
   - Implement key rotation

2. **Encryption in Transit**
   - Use TLS 1.2 or higher
   - Use strong cipher suites
   - Implement certificate pinning where appropriate
   - Use HSTS headers

3. **Key Management**
   - Use key management service (KMS)
   - Rotate keys regularly
   - Separate key management from data storage
   - Implement key access controls

### Input Validation

1. **Whitelist Approach**: Define what's allowed, reject everything else
2. **Validate Type, Length, Format, Range**: Check all aspects
3. **Canonicalize Input**: Normalize before validation
4. **Validate on Server**: Never trust client-side validation
5. **Sanitize for Context**: Different contexts need different sanitization

### Common Vulnerabilities

**SQL Injection Prevention**:
- Use parameterized queries (prepared statements)
- Never concatenate user input into SQL
- Use ORM with proper escaping
- Principle of least privilege for database accounts

**XSS Prevention**:
- Output encoding based on context (HTML, JavaScript, URL, CSS)
- Use Content Security Policy (CSP)
- Sanitize HTML input with allowlist
- Set X-XSS-Protection header

**CSRF Prevention**:
- Use anti-CSRF tokens
- Check Referer/Origin headers
- Use SameSite cookie attribute
- Require re-authentication for sensitive actions

**Clickjacking Prevention**:
- Use X-Frame-Options header
- Use Content-Security-Policy frame-ancestors
- Implement frame-busting JavaScript (defense in depth)

### Security Headers

```
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-Frame-Options: DENY
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
Permissions-Policy: geolocation=(), microphone=(), camera=()
```

### Compliance Considerations

**GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)**:
- Right to access personal data
- Right to rectification
- Right to erasure ("right to be forgotten")
- Right to data portability
- Consent management
- Data breach notification (72 hours)

**HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act)**:
- Protect PHI (Protected Health Information)
- Access controls and audit trails
- Encryption of PHI
- Business Associate Agreements (BAA)

**PCI-DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard)**:
- Never store CVV/CVC
- Encrypt cardholder data
- Use tokenization where possible
- Regular security testing
- Maintain secure network

### Security Testing

1. **SAST (Static Application Security Testing)**: Analyze source code
2. **DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing)**: Test running application
3. **SCA (Software Composition Analysis)**: Scan dependencies
4. **Penetration Testing**: Manual security testing by experts
5. **Bug Bounty**: Crowdsourced vulnerability discovery
