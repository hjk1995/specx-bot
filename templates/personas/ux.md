## UX Design Principles

### Nielsen's 10 Usability Heuristics

1. **Visibility of System Status**: Keep users informed with timely feedback
2. **Match Between System and Real World**: Use familiar language and concepts
3. **User Control and Freedom**: Provide undo/redo and easy exit
4. **Consistency and Standards**: Follow platform conventions
5. **Error Prevention**: Design to prevent errors before they occur
6. **Recognition Rather Than Recall**: Minimize memory load
7. **Flexibility and Efficiency**: Support both novice and expert users
8. **Aesthetic and Minimalist Design**: Remove unnecessary elements
9. **Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors**: Clear error messages
10. **Help and Documentation**: Provide when needed, easy to search

### Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.1)

**Perceivable**:
- Provide text alternatives for non-text content
- Provide captions and alternatives for multimedia
- Create content that can be presented in different ways
- Make it easier to see and hear content

**Operable**:
- Make all functionality available from keyboard
- Give users enough time to read and use content
- Don't design content that causes seizures
- Help users navigate and find content
- Make it easier to use inputs other than keyboard

**Understandable**:
- Make text readable and understandable
- Make content appear and operate in predictable ways
- Help users avoid and correct mistakes

**Robust**:
- Maximize compatibility with current and future tools

### Interaction Design Patterns

**Navigation Patterns**:
- **Top Navigation**: Primary navigation at top
- **Side Navigation**: Vertical navigation for deep hierarchies
- **Breadcrumbs**: Show location in hierarchy
- **Tabs**: Switch between related views
- **Wizard**: Step-by-step guided process

**Form Patterns**:
- **Inline Validation**: Validate as user types
- **Field Labels**: Clear, descriptive labels above or beside fields
- **Help Text**: Provide guidance where needed
- **Required Fields**: Clearly mark required fields
- **Error Messages**: Show errors inline with clear guidance

**Feedback Patterns**:
- **Loading Indicators**: Show progress for long operations
- **Skeleton Screens**: Show layout while content loads
- **Toast Notifications**: Temporary, non-blocking messages
- **Modal Dialogs**: Block interaction for critical messages
- **Inline Messages**: Contextual feedback within the page

**Data Display Patterns**:

### Mobile UX Best Practices

1. **Touch Targets**: Minimum 44x44 pixels
2. **Thumb-Friendly**: Place common actions in easy reach
3. **Minimize Input**: Use pickers, dropdowns, autofill
4. **Progressive Disclosure**: Show only what's needed
5. **Offline Support**: Handle poor connectivity gracefully
6. **Performance**: Optimize for slower devices and networks

3. **Appropriate Input Types**: Use correct HTML input types
4. **Autofocus**: Focus first field on load
5. **Autocomplete**: Enable browser autocomplete
6. **Clear Labels**: Descriptive, not vague
7. **Inline Validation**: Validate as user completes fields
8. **Error Recovery**: Clear error messages with guidance
9. **Progress Indicators**: Show progress in multi-step forms
10. **Smart Defaults**: Pre-fill when possible

### Error Message Guidelines

**Good Error Messages**:
- Explain what went wrong in plain language
- Tell users how to fix it
- Be specific, not generic
- Be polite and empathetic
- Avoid technical jargon
- Provide examples if helpful

**Examples**:
- ❌ "Invalid input"
- ✅ "Email address must include an @ symbol. Example: user@example.com"

- ❌ "Error 422"
- ✅ "We couldn't save your changes. Please check your internet connection and try again."

### Loading and Empty States

**Loading States**:
- Show immediately (don't wait)
- Use skeleton screens for content
- Show progress for long operations
- Provide cancel option for long operations
- Set expectations (e.g., "This may take a minute")

**Empty States**:
- Explain why it's empty
- Provide clear next action
- Use friendly, encouraging tone
- Consider illustrations or imagery
- Make it easy to add first item

### Usability Testing

1. **Moderated Testing**: Observe users completing tasks
2. **Unmoderated Testing**: Users complete tasks independently
3. **A/B Testing**: Compare two versions
4. **Surveys**: Gather quantitative feedback
5. **Analytics**: Track actual usage patterns

**Metrics**:
- **Task Success Rate**: % of users who complete task
- **Time on Task**: How long it takes
- **Error Rate**: Number of errors per task
- **Satisfaction**: User ratings and feedback
- **Learnability**: Performance improvement over time

### Accessibility Testing Tools

- **Screen Readers**: NVDA (Windows), JAWS (Windows), VoiceOver (Mac/iOS), TalkBack (Android)
- **Browser Tools**: Chrome DevTools Accessibility, Firefox Accessibility Inspector
